# Repo for Colt Steele's React Bootcamp
> Samples and assignments, some completed, some a WIP

Hey there! 👋

This is just some stuff I'm learning from Colt's course. I don't just do the code-a-longs and instead try to practice what I learn.

If you're frustrated at being stuck in tutorial hell, [read this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055PGUYU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) and take heart. You can do it. 👩‍💻 ❤️
